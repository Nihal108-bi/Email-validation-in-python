Note:-The email address "nihal@g.com" follows the basic structure of an email address, with a local part ("nihal") and a domain ("g.com"). However, the domain "g.com" is quite short and might not be a commonly used or recognized domain for email services.

In practice, email addresses are typically associated with well-known email service providers or organizations with longer and more specific domain names. Examples include gmail.com, yahoo.com, outlook.com, or custom domains like companyname.com.

If you are creating a personal email address, it might be more practical to use a well-known and reputable email service provider. If "g.com" is a domain you have control over or is suitable for your needs, technically, it can be used as part of an email address. Just ensure that it is available and follows any specific requirements set by the email service provider or system you are using. Additionally, consider the potential for confusion due to the brevity of the domain.
